# genetic_algorithm_sorting_trajectory
Evaluation of GAs for sorting trajectory optimization of robot manipulators in a very specific environment.

Contains the main script GA "sop_formulation_test.m", a function version of the GA, some test sets, separate functions for crossover and selection and some stuff to plot those test sets with the help of linspecer by Jonathan Lansey. 
For testing purposes Matlabs "ismember_mex"-function was added which might be helpful for crossover operations.
